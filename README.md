DataLab <V1.1.2>
=====
This software provides service capabilities like online analysis and intelligent analysis. The online analysis service supports online programming and online workflow analysis. It can pre-cache massive target data resources to the computing environment. Online programming analysis can be conducted on server-side IDE or notebook technologies like VS Code Server, Jupyter Notebook, etc., and supports commonly used data analysis languages like Python, R, SQL, Java, etc. Users can select shared datasets from the data center, write and execute code online. Online workflow analysis involves step-by-step analysis of shared datasets. Intelligent analysis services support  (MaaS) and conversational analysis. In the latter, users utilize the in-context learning capability of LLMs to discover target datasets, generate analysis codes, and orchestrate workflows automatically through natural languages or other intuitive methods.
